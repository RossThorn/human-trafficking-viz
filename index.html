        <h1>What is human trafficking? </h1>
        <p>At the core, it is taking egregious advantage of an individuals’s vulnerability. Formally, it is:</p>
        <ul>The <b>recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining</b> of a person for <b>labor or services</b>, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of <b>subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery</b>; </ul>
        <ul>and/or </ul>
        <ul><b>Sex trafficking</b> in which a commercial sex act is <b>induced by force, fraud, or coercion</b>, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age.<sup>2</sup></ul>
      </section>

      <section class="center" id="project">
        <p>The story we are telling here is not one of where human trafficking is necessarily <i>happening</i>, but of where and how people like you are <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/blue-campaign/indicators-human-trafficking">recognizing the signs</a> of potential human trafficking occurrences and reporting them by making calls to the <a href="https://humantraffickinghotline.org/">National Hotline</a>. We are also sharing where a fraction of the human trafficking cases have made it to trial in the United States, thanks to the first-of-its-kind, <a href="https://www.unodc.org/cld/en/v3/htms/cldb/index.html">publicly available collection of case law</a>, emphasizing the stories and resolutions of human trafficking experiences within the United States. </p>

        <h1>How many suffer?</h1>
        <p>There are an estimated <b>45.8 million people</b> held in slavery today. <b>57,700</b> of these people live within the U.S.<sup>6</sup>—a number just short of the entire population of Dubuque, Iowa, or enough people to overflow—by 15,000 people—Miller Park, or almost enough people to fill Lincoln Financial Field where comedian Kevin Hart just made history.<sup>7</sup> Imagine if 57,700 of the 68,532 ticketholders in the stadium had been segregated and forced into slavery. These would be victims of <b>human trafficking</b>. And, unfortunately, these estimates do not reflect the true number of victims suffering in our modern world, including in every single U.S. state.  In fact, Polaris estimates that the number of human trafficking victims in America is in actuality in the <em><i>hundreds of thousands</i></em>.<sup>8</sup> Whatever the number, each and every individual that suffers as a victim matters.</p>

        <h2><em>Amber* was a victim of human trafficking in the United States.</em></h2>
        <p>Amber lived with her cousin in St. Louis, Missouri. At 18 years old in 2008 and suffering from mental disabilities, she was persuaded by two sisters (American, 21 and 34 years of age) to move from her cousin’s apartment into their house on the 5200 block of Genevieve Avenue. The sisters had promised to take care of Amber and to help her to get her children back. Instead, they forced Amber into slavery, claiming that Amber must repay her own cousin’s contrived debt to one of the sisters. The sisters began stealing Amber’s monthly social security disability check. Amber was forced into prostitution on the street and from the house. She was also forced to do housework and suffered horrendous abuses, including being made to drink urine, perform acts of bestiality, being burned and gagged, tied to a chair, and left in the garage. A male housemate also forced Amber’s head into a bath full of water, and had concealed the crimes he was aware of from police on at least three occasions over two months.9 The sisters had threatened to hurt Amber’s mother and grandmother if she did not comply. In 2009, officers from the St. Louis Metro Police Department discovered Amber tied up in the garage. One of the sisters—as the primary perpetrator—claims to have been subjected to the same treatment by her own mother, and has lived in a world of drugs, abuse, and her own mental challenges since childhood. The three perpetrators were sentenced soon after pleading guilty, together amounting to 27.25 years to be spent in prison.<sup>10</sup><small><i> *Name is a pseudonym</i><a href="https://www.unodc.org/cld/case-law-doc/traffickingpersonscrimetype/usa/2005/united_states_v._wallace.html?lng=en&tmpl=htms"> (Case USA162)</a></small></p>

      <section class="center" id="transition">
        <p>Not all stories end in rescue and trial. But Amber’s did, as well as 180 other publicly documented cases seen in U.S. courts (see the final map). Victims of trafficking have diverse experiences and need an efficient justice system fueled by citizen recognition, action, and support. This is why it is essential for each of us to do our part in educating ourselves on trafficking and actively work to stop it from happening here at home.</p>

        <div class="questions">
          <p>The U.S. is a <b>source</b>, <b>transit</b>, and <b>destination</b> country for victims of human trafficking.<sup>1</sup> It occurs in small towns as well as large cities, online, along major transportation routes, at truck stops, at hair salons, at restaurants, to name just a few. It especially concentrates along <em>borders</em>, where legal jurisdictions vary. Human trafficking is a <em>network</em> facilitated through movement of individuals across borders at all scales, and victims are not static. Meanwhile, cybersex trafficking is without borders and astonishingly prevalent.<sup>11</sup> It is occurring right down your street, now, seen or unseen.</p>
          <p> Trafficking occurs in both legal and illicit industries, including:<sup>1</sup>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none">
              <li>hospitality</li>

        <div class="questions">
          <p>Human trafficking occurs when an individual’s vulnerability is taken advantage of. This exploitation happens every single day. </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><i>Why does human trafficking occur?</i> <b>BECAUSE WE ALLOW IT</b></button>
        <div class="questions">
          <p>Each of our lives is touched by it, every single day, through the businesses we support, the products we purchase, and our daily habits. Human trafficking is a <em>market-driven criminal industry, fueled by a demand for cheap labor, services, and for commercial sex</em>.<sup>4</sup> </p>
          <p>From the enslavement and abuse of a modestly estimated 21,000,000 (21 million) people worldwide, including the U.S. 3, in 2014 the forced labour industry alone made an estimated:
            <ul style="list-style-type:none">
              <li><b>$150,000,000,000</b> (150 billion) of illegal profits worldwide</li>
              <li><b>$99,000,000,000</b> (99 billion) from commercial sexual exploitation + </li>
              <li><b>$51,000,000,000</b> (51 billion) from forced economic exploitation:
                <ul>
                  <li><i>$34,000,000,000</i> (34 billion) in construction, manufacturing, mining and utilities + </li>
                  <li><i>$9,000,000,000</i> (9 billion) in agriculture, including forestry and fishing + </li>
                  <li><i>$8,000,000,000</i>  (8 billion) saved by private households by not paying or underpaying domestic workers held in forced labour. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Human traffickers perceive there to be little risk or deterrence to affect their criminal operations. This is why the rate of identifying and prosecuting cases needs to increase. Each of us is an important part of the solution.</p>

        <p>Recognizing how human trafficking is occurring in your local community is vital to saving lives and helping victims. In fact, community members contribute the most calls to the Polaris hotline.<sup>5</sup> Get to know your neighbors, those that provide you food and services, the people with whom your life is entwined. </p>

Importantly, volunteering at any local organization can help decrease the vulnerability of individuals and the likelihood that they will be trafficked. Time spent caring for and being there for children, especially at-risk children, is especially valuable. </p>

      <button class="accordion"><b>Advocate</b> for legislation and funding </button>
      <div class="questions">
        <p>Ending human trafficking requires constant vigilance, and legislation supporting this vigilance is not only essential but requires government funding to be successfully implemented. Require that your legislators represent your needs as well as the needs of the “invisible” victims of human trafficking. The U.S. government continues to make progress in addressing the prosecution, protection, and prevention of trafficking, and needs to continue to do so (for a list of recent actions and recommendations, see the <a href="https://paei.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2016/index.htm">2016 Trafficking In Persons Report</a>). </p>

      <div class="questions">
        <p>Also consider donating to any of the many non-governmental organizations that are combating trafficking and holding the government accountable in their efforts. The anti-trafficking model is proven to work, and donations fuel their operations. Highlighted as one of 10 non-profits "making a difference" by U.S. News and World Report, <a href="https://www.ijm.org/">the International Justice Mission</a>)—the largest anti-trafficking organization in the world—is one of the many where your dollars truly do make a difference. </p>

      <p><i><small>This is in no way a complete picture of these data in particular, of the experiences behind them, or of the multiplicities of realities surrounding this worldwide and domestically-driven industry of human trafficking within the U.S. It is an attempt to provide a new form of engagement with a small selection of the incredible resources and initiatives that exist today in the efforts against trafficking, focusing on the stories of victims. It is important to note that—due to its “hidden” and complex nature—human trafficking in the U.S. is recorded only in estimates and proxies. An accurate extent of its prevalence is lacking.
