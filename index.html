        <p>American citizens suffer everyday as victims of human trafficking, hidden in plain sight within the United States. In fact, in 2015 the United States was the number one country of origin of federally identified victims. (Trafficking in Persons Report 2016, 388)</p>
        <p>It is happening in our shared home, in our communities. </p>
        <p>And each of us is an important part of the solution. <b>STEP 1: Increasing your Awareness</b> of the issue is the first step you can take in fighting this heinous and hidden reality. So let us begin…</p>

        <h2>What is Human Trafficking?</h2>
        <p>At the core, it is taking egregious advantage of a person’s vulnerability. Formally, it is:</p>
        <ul>The recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.</ul>
          <ul>AND/OR</ul>
          <ul><em>sex trafficking</em> in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age
          </ul>
          <p>(Source: The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA))</p>

            <h2>Where Does it Happen?</h2>
            <p>Everywhere. Along major transportation routes, at truck stops, at massage parlors, at hair salons, at restaurants, in large cities and small towns, right down the street. “The United States is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, transgender individuals, and children—both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals—subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor. Trafficking occurs in both legal and illicit industries, including in commercial sex, hospitality, sales crews, agriculture, fishing, manufacturing, janitorial services, construction, restaurants, health and elder care, salon services, fairs and carnivals, peddling and begging, and domestic service. Government officials, companies, and NGOs have expressed concern about the risk of human trafficking in global supply chains, including in federal contracts.” (Source: Trafficking in Persons Report 2016, 387-388) It is essential to look outside your window and at those you are passing when you walk down the street. Opening your eyes to the reality that it is happening in your town or city, in one or many of the forms presented here, is vital to ending it.</p>

              <h2>Why Does it Happen?</h2>
              <p>But the story we are telling here is not one of where human trafficking is happening, but of how people like you are recognizing the signs  of potential human trafficking occurrences and reporting them by making calls from your state to the National Hotline. We are also sharing where a fraction of the human trafficking cases have made it to trial in the United States, thanks to the first-of-its-kind, publicly available collection published by the University of Michigan Law School, emphasizing stories and resolutions of human trafficking experiences within the United States.
                <p>In this way, we hope to enlighten you about: the complexity and common, close occurrence of trafficking within the United States; the documented experiences of victims; and, how we can defeat it by each of us taking action.</p> <p>[This is in no way a complete picture of these data, the experiences behind them, or of the multiplicities of realities surrounding this worldwide and domestically-driven industry, but it is an insight into these data from a lens meant to be sensitive towards its depiction.]</p>
