115,USA003,United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit,United States v. Jimenez-Calderon et al.,6/9/2006,NJ,"On February 22, 2002, police raided a house of prostitution in Plainfield, New Jersey. Four minors, young Mexican girls, were discovered and detained. Initially, the prostitutes working at the house were adults. However, in approximately November 2000, the Jimenez-Calderon sisters conspired with their brothers, Delfino and Luis Jimenez-Calderon (""Delfino and Luis""), to lure young girls from Mexico to work at the house. Delfino and Luis targeted girls from extremely impoverished families working in cafes in Mexico. Each of the girls worked far away from their families. They were young, naive, and had a low level of education. Some of the girls were illiterate. Delfino and Luis gave the girls gifts, pretended to be in love with them, and convinced them to go to the United States with them to get married and live a better life.
 
As part of their plan, Delfino and Luis asked the girls on a date after repeatedly visiting the girls at their place of work. They took the girls away from the towns where they lived and worked, and brought them to a motel, or house, where at least two girls were raped, and one consented to sexual intercourse. The girls were then taken to meet Delfino and Luis's mother. They introduced them as their future brides. The girls were then smuggled into the United States.
 
After the girls arrived at the brothel in New Jersey, they were handed over to Ms. Jimenez-Calderon and Librada and forced into prostitution. To help control the girls, Ms. Jimenez-Calderon and her siblings falsely represented that the girls were later to be married to Delfino and Luis. All of the money earned from prostitution at the house was turned over to Ms. Jimenez-Calderon. The girls were told that the money they earned would be given to their future husbands. They were told that Delfino and Luis were in Mexico. In reality, Delfino and Luis were in the United States. Ms. Jimenez-Calderon and Librada kept a portion of the money earned. The remainder was divided between Delfino and Luis, Mr. Ruiz, Ms. Lopez, and Mr. Burgos.
 
The girls were not allowed to be friendly or establish relationships with the customers, talk to each other, or make any phone calls. The girls were beaten if they broke the rules. On occasion, Ms. Jimenez-Calderon and Librada called Delfino or Luis to have them talk to the girls about their behavior.

The appellate court recognized that their sentences did not meet the sentencing guidelines.

The defendants were wealthy physicians, not career criminals.

In a companion case, Martinez v. Calimlim, 2010 WL 3610138 (E.D.Wis.), the victim in this case filed a civil lawsuit under the RICO Act (Racketeer Influenced & Corrupt Organizations).  The Calimlim’s insurers intervened in the lawsuit and argued that they have no duty to defend the defendants against Martinez’s claims. On 13 September 2010, the federal district court granted the insurance companies’ motion for summary judgment, which meant that the insurance agencies had no liability for the defendants’ actions claimed in the lawsuit.  This meant that the insurance agencies did not have to defend or pay damages from the civil claims of Ms. Martinez.

58,USA006,United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,United States v. Farrell,4/17/2009,SD,"Robert and Angelita Farrell, owners of a Comfort Inn & Suites hotel in South Dakota, committed visa fraud to bring Filipino workers to the United States to work in their hotel. As early as 2005, they began actively recruiting workers in the Philippines to come work for them. The Farrells took care of all fees to get the workers visas and drafted employment contracts for each of them (nine workers in total). They revealed that the workers would not be reimbursed for travel to the US (as required by the visa), but told the workers that their visas would be denied if they revealed this to any of the consular authorities.
 
Upon arrival, the Farrells enslaved the workers to perform cleaning and front desk duties at the hotel. Angelita demanded the workers surrender their passports, visas, and immigration documents to her. Then the Farrells informed the workers that they would not be getting the contract provisions as agreed (1/2 the wage promised). They indebted the workers to them by demanding repayment of all processing fees, as well as charging them transportation fees to get to and from their places of employment. They also required that the workers obtain a second job at fast food or other service establishments, in direct violation of their visas.
 
The workers were not permitted to leave their shared apartment, even to visit the drug store, without asking permission from either the Farrells or the hotel manager, Alma Navarro. Frequently, the Farrells told the workers that they were not to speak with anyone outside of the hotel and that they were prohibited from socializing with Americans. The prohibition against speaking to other people went so far as to preclude the workers from speaking to the non-Filipino workers who were employed at the same hotel. The workers were also required to work 13 hours a day, 7-days a week. Their income was insufficient to meet their mounting debt. The Farrells threatened to send the workers back to the Philippines in a small box or call the immigration authorities if the workers failed to repay them. There were also instances of Robert Farrell keeping delinquent workers in a room all night while yelling at them.

Defendant KBR is a business conglomerate; one such KBR subsidiary serves as a contractor with the United States Government to perform specific duties at United States military installations in Iraq.
 
In an effort to fulfill their contractual obligations, the Defendants ""willfully and intentionally formed an enterprise with the goal of procuring cheap labor and increasing profits"", and therefore engaged in human trafficking. Most of the men were told that they would be employed by a luxury hotel in Amman, Jordan. Some were told that that they would be working in an American camp. They were promised a salary of approximately $ 500 per month. The men and their families incurred substantial debt to pay the brokerage fees in seeking out this employment.
 
The men were held in Jordan by Daoud and agents of Daoud; all of the men were required to turn over their passports to Daoud. It was there that they first discovered that they were actually being sent to Iraq to work on Al Asad Air Base, Iraq. At least one of the men informed his family that he and the other men were being kept in a dark room and were unable to see. The men were also informed that they would be paid only three quarters of what they were initially promised. Daoud transported the victims into Iraq on or about August 19, 2004, via an unprotected automobile caravan. Daoud was aware of the significant and well-known risks involved in traveling on this highway. No security was provided for the caravan.
 
Between August 20 and August 24, the Ansar al-Sunna Army posted an internet statement that it had captured ten (10) of the men, on or about August 31, 2004. International media outlets broadcasted video of the Ansar al-Sunna Army executing the twelve (12) plaintiffs. The group beheaded one of the men, and shot the other eleven men in the back of their heads. Plaintiff BPG’s car was not captured by the insurgents and arrived at Al Asad base as scheduled. He was told by both Daoud and KBR that he could not leave until his work in Iraq was complete. After fifteen months, during which he experienced frequent mortar fire without protection, BPG was permitted to return to Nepal.
 
The plaintiffs alleged that:
 
- KBR knew or should have known prior to August 2004 of the circumstances under which the men were being brought to Iraq to work;
 
- Daoud was previously involved in an incident in which eighteen Indian laborers were forcibly kept in a camp in Fallujah where they worked, although they had quit their jobs months before;
 
- KBR had the authority to terminate all subcontractors who mistreated employees, unlawfully compelled employees to perform work, or unlawfully compelled employees to remain somewhere against their will.; This case was brought by Plaintiff BPG and the surviving family members of twelve other men. Defendant Daoud & Partners (""Daoud"") is a Jordanian corporation. Daoud had entered into a number of contracts with the United States for the provision of services at military bases, including Al Asad Air Base in Iraq. Defendant KBR is a business conglomerate; one such KBR subsidiary serves as a contractor with the United States Government to perform specific duties at United States military installations in Iraq.
 
In an effort to fulfill their contractual obligations, the Defendants ""willfully and intentionally formed an enterprise with the goal of procuring cheap labor and increasing profits"", and therefore engaged in human trafficking. Most of the men were told that they would be employed by a luxury hotel in Amman, Jordan. Some were told that that they would be working in an American camp.

77,USA010,United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia,United States vs. Harrison Norris,4/1/2008,GA,"Since 2001, Norris had been running a prostitution business in the Atlanta, Ga., area. From April 2005 to August of 2005, Norris and his co-conspirator Aimee Allen, recruited and forced women, many of whom were poor, homeless or addicted to drugs, to work for Norris as prostitutes and servants in his two Cartersville, Ga., homes. The case cites 10 victims ranging in age from 19 to 27, all American, females. Norris lured several victims to his homes by false promises that he would train them to become successful wrestlers in his female wrestling company. Another co-conspirator, Cedric Jackson, kidnapped at least one victim and provided her to Norris.
 
Norris isolated the victims from their families and friends and monitored them at all times to prevent their escape. Norris’s control over the victims included a strict military structure that he imposed in his home. The defendant assigned each of his victims to a “squad” overseen by a “team leader,” a woman conspiring with Norris to keep the victims in servitude. Forced acts of prostitution occurred at nightclubs, apartments, hotels, in the back of Norris’ truck, and in other locations in North Carolina and northern Georgia. The profits from Norris’ forced prostitution business were collected by him and held in his safe, along with the victims’ identifications and cellular phones. The victims were forced to engage in sexual conduct with Norris as well.
 
Norris also made the victims work in and around his two homes in Cartersville, performing domestic labor, including hauling trees, laying sod, and painting. Norris set strict rules and fined the women for such infractions as talking too much or failing to exercise. In addition, Norris kept the women financially indebted to him by charging them for food, medicine, rent, and cigarettes. Norris then told the victims that they could not leave until their debts were paid, all the while continuing to increase the debt he claimed he was owed. Co-defendants Allen and Jackson had previously pleaded guilty. Allen was sentenced to 2 years and 10 months in prison.

38,USA011,United States District Court for the District of New Jersey,United States v. Afolabi,8/20/2010,?,"According to a summary in the superseding indictment, from October 2002 through September 2007, Akouavi Kpade Afolabi engaged in conspiracy to obtain fraudulent visas to have Togolese females enter into the US with the purpose of forced labor. Akouavi Afolabi and her co-conspirators made use of “DV-1 Holder”. DV-1 visa is a diversity visa which allows the selected Togolese to stay in the US for one year. Those selected Togolese were eligible to apply for diversity visas for their immediate family members. Akouavi Kpade Afolabi and another co-conspirator, Geoffry Kouevi, sought individuals with a type of visa which would allow the holders to bring spouses or children with them into the country as a “DV-1 Holder”. She would then solicit “DV-1 Holder” to falsely claims for non-relatives as family members. Kouevi taught the recruits to study facts about their fake husbands and fathers in order to pass interviews at the U.S. Embassy, prepared all of the paperwork necessary for them to obtain their visas, and obtained fraudulent passports for them.
 
The operation, authorities say, targeted victims from impoverished African villages, some as young as 10. Akouavi Afolabi deceived victims and their families into believing that they could have a better life, for instance, having a good education at school. Akouavi Afolabi arranged and prepared recruiting, obtaining, and travelling to the US. After entering the US, Lassissi Afolabi (owner of Ashley’s Hair Braiding Salon), and Dereck Hounakey (owner of Newark Hair Braiding), both co-conspirators, took the victims to the residence in New Jersey. In order to control the victims, Akouavi Afolabi, Lassissi Afolabi, and Dereck Hounakey took possession of their passports, visas, and other travel documents .
 
Over the course of the conspiracy, Kouevi helped to fraudulently obtain more than 25 visas. Once the young women and girls entered the United States, Akouavi Kpade Afolabi, and her ex-husband required the victims to work at hair braiding salons for up to 14 hours per day, six to seven days a week. The victims were also required to turn over all of their earnings, including their tips, to the defendants. The defendants did not allow the girls to keep their passports or identification; to speak with their families outside of the defendants’ presence; or to make any outside friends. They were rarely permitted to leave their respective residence, all of which were controlled by the defendants, other than to work. When a victim broke a rule, she was punished, often physically, by one of the Afolabis.; According to a summary in the superseding indictment, from October 2002 through September 2007, Akouavi Kpade Afolabi engaged in conspiracy to obtain fraudulent visas to have Togolese females enter into the US with the purpose of forced labor.

23,USA019,United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,United States v. Dann,7/22/2011,CA,"U.S. citizen Mabelle de la Rosa Dann recruited Peruvian victim P.C. to come to the United States as her nanny and housekeeper, promising P.C. that she would be paid $600 per month plus free room and board in exchange for working five days per week during regular business hours. But once P.C. arrived, Dann seized P.C.'s passport, and refused to pay her for two years. P.C. regularly worked from 6 a.m. until 9 p.m., and was prohibited from communicating with others or listening to Spanish language radio and television. At one point, Dann told P.C. that she owed her $13,000 and needed to work to repay the debt. Dann also asked P.C. to sign a document stating she had been paid minimum wage. This document along with P.C.’s Peruvian identification and passport were found by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Dann’s clothing drawer.
 
At trial, Dann argued that P.C.’s testimony was tainted by her incentive to lie to obtain a T-visa and remain in the United States and that their relationship was similar to that of two female family members. The Government, in contrast, presented a case where Dann is a woman in need of free or cheap labor, who exploited P.C. and held her in slave-like conditions. The appellate court notes that because Dann was convicted, her story has been judged as less credible by the jury.; U.S. citizen Mabelle de la Rosa Dann recruited Peruvian victim P.C. to come to the United States as her nanny and housekeeper, promising P.C. that she would be paid $600 per month plus free room and board in exchange for working five days per week during regular business hours.

In doing so, the court considered the legislative history of the TVPA (2000) and noted that “legislative history suggests that Congress, in passing the act, intended to reach cases in which persons are held in a condition of servitude through nonviolent coercion.'"" (2011 WL 2937944, *8 (C.A.9 (Cal.)) (citing the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 § 102(b)(13)).

The Circuit Court also noted that “not all bad employer-employee relationships or even bad employer-immigrant nanny relationships will constitute forced labour. . . . the threat of harm must be serious” and the employer must have “intended to cause the victim to believe that she would suffer serious harm – from the vantage point of the victim – if she did not continue to work.” The key under section 1589, according to the court, is not just “that serious harm was threatened but that the employer intended the victim to believe that such harm would befall her.”

The Court considered the threats from Dann and asked whether from the perspective of P.C., these harms were sufficiently serious to compel her to remain with Dann. They answered that the threats of financial harm, reputational harm, immigration harm, and harm to Dann’s children were sufficient to compel a reasonable person in P.C.’s position  to remain with Dann and so Dann intended to make P.C. believe she would suffer serious harm if PC ceased working for Dann.",NA,Domestic servitude,Recruitment; Harbouring,Threat or use of force or other forms of coercion; Deception; Abuse of power or a position of vulnerability,Servitude,Transnational,1,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes

161,USA028,United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,United States v. Booker,7/30/1981,?,"

Two of the defendants picked up three migrant workers under false promises of providing steady work and free transportation to the work site. In reality, the defendants delivered the workers to the labor camp operated by the third defendant, Booker.

The defendants forced the individuals to work by use of constant threats of physical violence. Employment was intermittent and the defendants informed the workers that they would have to work to pay off the transportation to the work site as well as the meals they consumed while they remained idle. The workers were forbidden to leave, and were required to make all retail purchases at the campsite. When two of the workers attempted to leave to go to a nearby store, two of the defendants physically beat them, forced them into a van, and returned them to the labor camp.

47,USA033,United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit of New York,United States v. Mahender Murlidhar Sabhnani and Varsha Mahender Sabhnani,3/25/2010,?,"The 1st victim, a 53 year old woman from Indonesia, was arranged to travel to the US by the 2nd defendant’s mother, “Mrs. Joti”, in order to work in the US as a domestic servant for $ 200 per month. She was a rice vender who could not speak English, and had very limited knowledge about visas. She was brought to the US, accompanied by Mrs. Joti in February 2002.
 
Upon her arrival, the defendants met her at the airport and then took her to their home. The 2nd defendant took the 1st victims passport and other travel related documents, and kept them until approximately April 2007, about one year after her passport had expired. While the 1st victim was in charge of cooking, cleaning, laundry, and other chores at the defendants’ house, she also did not receive the promised amount of money, $200 per month; instead the defendants gave her daughter in Indonesia $100 per month, so the victim did not receive any money from the defendants.
 
The circumstances of the victim’s employment was more than severe; she was required to sleep on carpet outside the bedroom, and later on a floor mat in the kitchen. She worked for extremely long hours per day and was often deprived of sleep. The 2nd defendant refused to provide the victim with even the semblance of adequate clothing. The victim was also subjected to extremely harsh physical, and psychological treatment in the defendants’ home; the 2nd defendant beat the victim with various household objects; she was punished for sleeping late, for not receiving permission to throw out the garbage, for stealing food from the trash, and for failing to clean the garbage. The 2nd defendant also threatened the victim with a photograph showing her with milk, which could be used to show as if she was stealing the milk; by telling her that she would be killed by the 1st defendant; and by the letter which she was forced to write by the 2nd defendant. The victim was told that if she wanted to go back to Indonesia, she would have pay for all expenses for her travel back, and that she would be arrested by the police because of her illegal status. Most of the victim’s day-to-day supervision came from the 2nd defendant, though the 1st defendant also ordered her to serve various jobs and knew of the victim’s harsh employment conditions.
 
The 1st defendant even reported the victim’s mistakes to the 2nd defendant, even though he understood the 2nd defendant would beat the victim for them. The 2nd victim, who was a 47 year old woman from Indonesia, was also recruited by Mrs. Joti in Indonesia. She had completed only first grade, and was unable to speak English. Immediately after her arrival upon the US, in January 2005, the defendants required her to work at their house. The 2nd defendant took her passport and other relevant documents, and kept them in the same locked place as one in which the 1st victim’s passport and other relevant documents were kept, until May 2007, nearly 2 years after the 2nd victim was required to depart from the US.
 
Like the 1st victim, employment circumstances were severe; she was made to work lengthy hours; was generally denied food, sleep, and even medical care when she was sick or injured. She was also a witness to the 1st victim’s maltreatment at the 2nd defendant’s hands. Though she was not excluded from it; the 2nd defendant forced her to walk up and down stairs repeatedly as punishment for supposed misconduct. The victim was threatened by the 2nd defendant as well as the victim; he told her that if she ran away, the police would shoot her. She was also told that if she left, her husband in Indonesia, who had received advanced payment for her services, would be arrested. On the evening of May 12, 2007, the 1st victim ran away from the defendants’ house during their absence, carrying the expired Indonesian passport. She was taken to the medical center, and then reported to the police.

157,USA057,United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,United States v. Joseph Morales,6/8/1995,NY,"

Defendants operated a trafficking ring that prostituted women in New York City brothels. Defendants smuggled the victims into the United States from Thailand. Once here, the women were housed in a brothel in the Chinatown neighborhood and forced to engage in commercial sex acts to repay their smuggling debt. Evidence presented at sentencing hearings showed that the victims were housed in a guarded brothel, which they could not leave without supervision. Additionally, defendants used threats of physical violence to coerce the victims.

As the head of security at a brothel, defendant Morales was responsible for keeping the women under their captors� control. He knew that the women were undocumented individuals smuggled into United States and that their captors were forcing them to repay their smuggling debts through prostitution.

Morales, a former corrections officer, was found guilty by a federal jury.

Other defendants accepted plea bargains. Defendant pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit involuntary servitude and conspiracy to promote prostitution. Defendant Wattanasari was sentenced to 90 months imprisonment and three years of supervised release.

At least one of the victims was imprisoned for lying to federal prosecutors. When interviewed by investigations, some of the women falsely claimed that they did not realize prior to arriving in the United States that they would be working as prostitutes.

William Alexander Lewis,9/22/1986,MI,"The defendants were leaders of a religious sect, House of Judah, first established in Chicago. The victims, adolescent boys, lived with their parents at a sect camp in Michigan. In March 1982, sect leader William A. Lewis convinced members of the camp to sign a document whereby they agreed to submit to various forms of physical punishment (including death, banishment, confiscation of material goods, imprisonment, beating, burning, hanging or stoning of both the adult member and that member's children), for failing to adhere to the sect�s strict code of behavior and discipline. (Lewis believed that corporal punishment, referred to as ""chastisement,"" was a proper and necessary means of punishment for those who broke the rules of the House of Judah). Under Lewis�s authority and direction, members of the camp were subjected to beatings and whippings. As an implementation of the whipping policy, and as a means of instilling fear in both adults and children, Prophet Lewis ordered construction of a whipping block. It was fashioned after the stocks used in colonial days containing holes for the head and hands to confine offenders during the whippings.

In addition to the Prophet, the camp was also run by a council composed of the Prophet's closest associates, including his son and the Prophetess. All of the council members were appointed by the Prophet, and all of the defendants, during the period covered by the indictment, served at one time or another on this leadership council.

Defendants Jones, Branson, and McGee were frequently, but not always, the individuals selected by the Prophet to administer the punishment of ""licks"" - ""as hard as you can swing.""

""The 13th Amendment and its enforcing statutes are designed to apply to a variety of circumstances and conditions. Neither is limited to the classic form of slavery. Both apply to contemporary as well as to historic forms of involuntary servitude. The amendment and statutes were intended not merely to end slavery but to maintain a system of completely free and voluntary labor throughout the United States.... [I]n general, the defense against oppressive hours, pay, working conditions, or treatment is the right to change employers. When the master can compel and the laborer cannot escape the obligation to go on, there is no power below to redress and no incentive above to relieve a harsh over lordship or unwholesome conditions of work. [quoting in part Pollock v. Williams,322 U.S. 4, 17-18, 64 S.Ct. 792, 799-800, 88 L.Ed. 1095 (1944)].""

The defendant paid the employees substandard wages, typically $250 to $300 per week for 60 to 70 hours of work, thereby gaining a competitive commercial advantage over other restaurants that paid workers at least minimum wage. The employees were paid ""off the books"", which facilitated his scheme to under-report gross receipts at the restaurants.

Simon Banda-Mireles and Resendiz often moved the illegal and undocumented workers from restaurant to restaurant to meet staffing needs, and also to shield the aliens from detection by U.S. immigration officials. Resendiz routinely advised workers, most of whom who did not speak English, to avoid contact with customers in order to minimize the chances of their status being detected.

Donald Wayne Fint,9/7/2010,"MI, OH","Defendants Donald Wayne Flint and James Roney transported the victims, a 15-year old girl and an adult woman, to Detroit, Michigan from Cleveland, Ohio, for the purpose of engaging in prostitution. Upon their arrival in Detroit, Flint, Roney and the victims went to a strip club operated by one of Roney’s relatives, to try to get the girls some work there. They were rejected, however, as neither of the girls had proper paperwork.
 
The defendants rented a hotel room, where the four spent the night. The next day, the defendants supplied the victims with clothing and condoms, and also bought marijuana and ecstasy, which the two women ingested. At some time or times during the day and evening, Roney had sex with both of the women and Flint had sex with the minor victim in the hotel room. That night, Roney and Flint took the two women to a location known as “the track,” an area where prostitutes go to meet customers, so that the women could make some money as prostitutes. At some point, the two women met a customer and took him to a hotel (not the room in which the four had been staying) and had sex with him in exchange for $60. They gave the money to Roney and Flint and returned to the track. Later in the night, the minor victim found yet another customer with whom she had sex.
 
However, undercover police surveying the area had taken note of the two women because they were dressed alike and were unknown to the police officers, who were familiar with the regular prostitutes. At about 7:00 a.m. on the following morning, the police followed the adult victim and Roney to the hotel where they met up with Flint. The police approached and while they were questioning these three, the minor victim arrived (she had been gone for several hours). One of the prostitution-task-force officers suspected that Jane was a minor and asked her age. She said she was 20, but after persistent questioning, she finally admitted that she was 15.; Defendants Donald Wayne Flint and James Roney transported the victims, a 15-year old girl and an adult woman, to Detroit, Michigan from Cleveland, Ohio, for the purpose of engaging in prostitution.

Also significant was the consideration of the Child Exploitation Enterprise charge since federal courts had not considered the elements of the crime and requirements for conviction. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 enhances punishment for sex trafficking of minors and carries a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years in prison. When interpreting the child exploitation statute, the appellate court analogized to the Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act that has similar language about participating in a “continuing criminal enterprise”. The appellate court interpreted the statute to require three elements: 1. a series of three separate predicate offenses, 2. over one minor victim, and 3. the offenses must have been committed with three or more other people. Daniels argued that each of the three predicate offences must be committed with three other people but the court disagreed believing that the three or more persons requirement applies to the series of felony violations and the three persons can be added from considering the three predicate counts together. In this case, then, the “government . . . needed to present sufficient evidence that a total of at least three other persons acted in concert with Daniels to commit one or more of the counts.” (page 15).",NA,Commercial sexual exploitation,Recruitment; Transportation; Transfer,Threat or use of force or other forms of coercion,Exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation,Internal,89+,Yes,Yes,NA*,Yes,Yes,Yes*,No

Webster targeted and recruited vulnerable adult and minor females who were homeless, in low-paying jobs or runaways, and invited them to work for his purported ""escort services"", where an individual would supposedly pay for another person’s ""time and company."" The defendant, however, forced the victims to engage in prostitution.
 
The defendant’s prostitution business operated on an “out call” basis, meaning that the clients would call the escort services’ phone lines, and in exchange for money, the defendant would provide adult women and underage girls who would meet the caller at his residence or at a hotel paid for by the caller to engage in sex acts. The callers would agree in advance to pay a fixed hourly rate plus a transportation fee in order to meet with a woman, and then would pay additional money in exchange for sex acts or drugs which Webster provided.
 
The defendant provided housing for the girls and women he recruited at six homes in Anchorage. The defendant controlled the victims completely, with the purpose of ensuring their continued cooperation: he threatened them, took away their personal identification and other properties, forbid any interaction with persons outside of the organization, he threatened his victims and violently assaulted them if they tried to leave or disobeyed him. The victims were also required to give the defendant all of the money they earned. When they returned from a “date”, the defendant would take their earnings and give them an “issue”, which was approximately one gram of crack cocaine.

Plaintiffs sued the defendants under the Alien Tort Statute (28 USC 1350), claiming that the defendants had engaged in and conspired to engage in slave trade and in forced child labour in violation of the law of nations. Plaintiffs also brought state law claims of battery, assault, intentional and/or negligent infliction of emotional distress, wrongful death, and survival claims against the defendants. The suit was brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky.
 
This class action arose from the trafficking of young boys from Africa and South Asia, aged 2-12 (approximately), to work in the camel racing industry in the United Arab Emirates and other Arab states. According to the complaint, young boys were abducted and/or sold and enslaved in camel training camps to work as trainers and jockeys under the supervision of overseers. The children were reportedly starved, beaten, sexually abused and forced to work under harsh and oppressive conditions. When the children reached their teen years, and became too big to ride as jockeys, they were abandoned (e.g. sent back to their homeland) without any education, resources or assistance.
 
Ultimately, the federal District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky dismissed this case for lack of personal jurisdiction over the named defendant.; The plaintiffs were former child camel jockeys and their parents.

This class action arose from the trafficking of young boys from Africa and South Asia, aged 2-12 (approximately), to work in the camel racing industry in the United Arab Emirates and other Arab states. According to the complaint, young boys were abducted and/or sold and enslaved in camel training camps to work as trainers and jockeys under the supervision of overseers. The children were reportedly starved, beaten, sexually abused and forced to work under harsh and oppressive conditions. When the children reached their teen years, and became too big to ride as jockeys, they were abandoned (e.g. sent back to their homeland) without any education, resources or assistance.
 
Ultimately, the federal District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky dismissed this case for lack of personal jurisdiction over the named defendant.",https://www.unodc.org/cld/case-law-doc/traffickingpersonscrimetype/usa/2008/mother_doe_i_v._sheikh_hamdan_bin_rashid_al_maktoum.html?lng=en&tmpl=htms,NA,NA,Other sectors,"Recruitment;

“Operation Guardian Angel was conducted by the Human Trafficking Rescue Project, a joint task force from the Independence Police Department, the FBI, ICE, and the Kansas City, Mo., Police Department. During the undercover operation, task force officers placed Internet ads for underage prostitutes. According to court documents, the ads clearly stated that the prostitutes were “little girls” and were “young.” Those who responded to the ads were given directions to an undercover location that was outfitted with audio and video recording equipment. When they arrived at the undercover residence and paid cash for a child prostitute, they were arrested by task force officers.

This operation marks the first time that the U.S. Department of Justice has utilized the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to prosecute customers who allegedly attempt to pay for sex with children. While the pimps who offer to sell children to others for prostitution have been prosecuted in the Western District and elsewhere, these indictments are the first in the nation to charge a “John” with attempting to pay for sex with a child.”",NA,Commercial sexual exploitation,Receipt,Giving or receiving payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person,Exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation,Internal,NA*,NA,NA,NA,No,Yes,NA,NA

The plaintiffs are Indonesian women (“victims”) and were brought to the United States by Mrs. Sabhnani’s mother, “Mrs. Joti,” to live and work in the Sabhanis’ home. Mrs. Joti returned to Indonesia after each trip. Upon the victims’ arrival to the United States, their documents were confiscated. When at the Sabhanani’s residence, they were forced to sleep on the floor, beaten and forced to work for the Mr. and Mrs. Sabhnani for a wage of $100 (USD) a month (lower than the $200 (USD) per month they were promised). The victims were not given enough food to subsist and often took food from the trash. When they were caught taking food from the trash, they were beaten.
 
Criminal charges arose from the defendants (now respondents) actions. The defendants were convicted by a federal jury of Forced Labor (18 U.S.C. § 1589(a)), Harboring Aliens (8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii)), Holding a Person in a Condition of Peonage (18 U.S.C. § 1581(a)), and Domestic Servitude (18 U.S.C. § 1592(a)), as well as Conspiracy to commit each of these substantive offenses. 
 
After the criminal convictions, the district court awarded restitution damages to the plaintiffs under 18 U.S.C. § 1593 - The Court awarded one victim $310,371.91 and awarded the other victim $157,901.20 in back pay/wages. The Court also awarded both victims an additional $310,371.91 and $157,901.20, respectively, as liquidated damages. See U.S. v. Sabhnani, 566 F. Supp. 2d 139, 147 (E.D.N.Y. 2008), overruled in part by Sabhnani Verdict Appeal, 599 F.3d 251, 256 (2d Cir. 2010). The restitution award was partially overruled when the court found that as domestic servants, the plaintiffs were not workers who could receive overtime pay. Therefore, the restitution award was remanded to calculate again without including overtime payments. The criminal convictions and the rest of the restitution award were upheld. For more information on the criminal case, refer to USA 033 on our database (See the ‘Source/Citation’ section for the link).
 
Subsequent to the criminal case, the plaintiff victims filed this present case, a civil suit seeking monetary damages from the respondents based on eleven causes of action under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. § 1595), the federal and state wage laws, and the common law. The plaintiffs withdrew some of the causes of action - a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”) claim, a claim for federal overtime wages, and a claim for battery against respondent Mr. Sabhnani. Then, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on all of the claims they did not withdraw, arguing that the respondents’ prior criminal convictions barred them from contesting the plaintiffs’ civil claims. The court granted the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on almost every count.; The co-respondents, Varsha Sabhnani (“Mrs. Sabhnani”) and Mahender Sabhnani (“Mrs. Sabhnani”), are married and used to live with their children in a home in the State of New York.

Supp. 2d 139, 147 (E.D.N.Y. 2008), overruled in part by Sabhnani Verdict Appeal, 599 F.3d 251, 256 (2d Cir. 2010). The restitution award was partially overruled when the court found that as domestic servants, the plaintiffs were not workers who could receive overtime pay. Therefore, the restitution award was remanded to calculate again without including overtime payments. The criminal convictions and the rest of the restitution award were upheld.

Subsequent to the criminal case, the plaintiff victims filed this present case, a civil suit seeking monetary damages from the respondents based on eleven causes of action under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. § 1595), the federal and state wage laws, and the common law. The plaintiffs withdrew some of the causes of action - a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”) claim, a claim for federal overtime wages, and a claim for battery against respondent Mr. Sabhnani. Then, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on all of the claims they did not withdraw, arguing that the respondents’ prior criminal convictions barred them from contesting the plaintiffs’ civil claims. The court granted the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on almost every count.",https://www.unodc.org/cld/case-law-doc/traffickingpersonscrimetype/usa/2011/docket_number_-_no._08-cv-2970_adswdw_2011.html?lng=en&tmpl=htms,"The criminal convictions allowed the plaintiffs to seek civil redress without having to have a trial on most of their civil claims, applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel.

From 2001 to, at least, 2009, co-defendant, George, organized and operated a prostitution business where he exchanged the commercial sexual services of young female victims for profit. All revenue was turned over to George. 
 
Co-defendant, George, targeted women who were vulnerable, including those who had been abused as children, those who were running away from home, and those who did not have enough money to provide for their children. George would also use psychological manipulation to coerce the victims to work for him by using shame or guilt about existing family issues. Co-defendants, George and Heckstall, lured the victims into prostitution with the promise of extravagant lifestyles; though, once recruited, they intimidated, coerced and compelled the female victims to stay by using threats of and actual physical violence against them and their families. The victims could not socialize with or contact others. George would repeatedly strike, punch, kick, push, rape and use other physical acts and intimidation to scare and bully the victims. In September 2008, they recruited a 17-year-old minor female victim for purposes of prostitution. In October 2008, they recruited an 18-year-old adult female for the same purpose. One victim was confined to a hotel room for several months, during which time George physically and sexually abused her in addition to making her work as a prostitute. 
 
Co-defendant, Muttaqui, helped by driving the victims to their “out calls,” providing protection and helping in other aspects of the prostitution business. 
 
Co-defendant, Lazar, participated by producing fabricated credit cards using stolen identities and credit information. All four co-defendants used these illegally made credit cards to recruit new victims and support the sex trafficking conspiracy. The co-defendants also used the internet to advertise the victims’ sexual services.

Co-defendants, Corey, Harris, Johnson, Tyler, along with others, transported and enticed at least 12 female victims, both adult and minor, to travel to Maryland.

The co-defendants also used MySpace.com, YouTube.com and other web-based social networking services, to recruit female victims to serve as prostitutes and to promote their prostitution business.
 
Co-defendant, Corey, received a percentage of all earnings from the prostitution business. These earnings could range in the thousands of dollars per week. He used some of these earnings to buy, among other things, MDMA (Ecstasy or Molly) and Benzylpiperazine (BZP - a drug which has a stimulant effect on the central nervous system similar to that of ecstasy) from a drug dealer in Detroit, Michigan.
